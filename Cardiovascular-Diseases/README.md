This project essentially deals with the causes of CVD's and various habits related that lead to an individual suffering from the same. In this project, we
have used a pre-existing dataset related to patients suffering from CVD's and their daily habits. After cleaning and conducting exploratory data analysis
techniques, we have used several models to predict the onset of CVD's in an individual; given his age, daily habits, etc.
